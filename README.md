# Introduction

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are the building blocks for developing software applications. Data structures, on the other hand, are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. Mastery of algorithms and data structures is fundamental for writing efficient code.
Languages
The implementations in this repository are provided in the following programming languages:
* Python

* JavaScript

  
Feel free to contribute implementations in other languages as well.
Algorithms
The repository includes implementations of various algorithms such as:
* Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
* Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
* Dynamic Programming Algorithms (Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
* Greedy Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm)
* String Matching Algorithms (Brute Force, KMP Algorithm)
Data Structures
The repository includes implementations of fundamental data structures such as:
* Arrays
* Linked Lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List)
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
* Graphs (Directed Graph, Undirected Graph)
* Hash Tables
